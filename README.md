PersonaForge is an AI-powered tool that helps product builders, strategists, and researchers deeply understand their users by generating emotionally intelligent, fairness-aware, and context-rich personas.

Unlike traditional persona tools, PersonaForge goes beyond surface-level traits to reveal behavioral drivers, trust factors, exclusion risks, and real-world constraints — empowering teams to build more inclusive, effective, and strategically aligned products.
